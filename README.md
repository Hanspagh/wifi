Wifi for Elixir
===============
Various utility functions for working with the local Wifi network in Elixir. These functions are mostly useful in scripts that could benefit from knowing the current location of the computer or the Wifi surroundings.

This project is inspired by [wifi-location](https://github.com/wearefractal/wifi-location) by [Fractal](https://github.com/wearefractal) and [node-wifiscanner](https://github.com/mauricesvay/node-wifiscanner) by [Maurice Svay](https://github.com/mauricesvay).

**Please help**: So far the project will only work on Mac OS X and Linux. If you are running Windows (or any of the BSDs) please make a scanner-wrapper that implements `Wifi.Scanner.*name*.utility/0`, `Wifi.Scanner.*name*.scan/0` and `Wifi.Scanner.*name*.parse/1`. Refer to the `Wifi.Scanner.Airport` implementation. On Windows the utility `netsh` should be helpful. Thanks.


Features
--------
Currently the project implements the following

  * `Wifi.scan/0` return a list of local Wifi base stations with information such as security modes and signal strength.
  * `Wifi.location/0` will attempt to triangulate the psychical location of the computer running the script based on triangulation using the local Wifi surroundings and Googles location APIs.

Pull requests or feature requests are more than welcome if you have suggestions and ideas on how to work with Wifi. Also, I (Martin Gausby) needs help making this run on Unix-like and Windows systems. Current only Mac OS X and Linux are supported.


Installation
------------
The project is available on [hex.pm](https://hex.pm/) as [Wifi](http://hex.pm/packages/wifi). Add it to your mix dependencies using the decided version, ie: `{:wifi, "~> 0.0.1"}`, and be sure to add `:wifi` to the `applications` list, as we need to start the Hackney application for the `Wifi.location/0` function to work.
